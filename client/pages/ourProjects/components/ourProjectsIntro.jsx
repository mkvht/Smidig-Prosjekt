          Our platform has two categories: knowledge and water. We know that
          these two areas are vital to thriving societies - this is why our
          portfolio focuses on them. Many corporate giving systems don't
          thoroughly vet the projects and nonprofits that are featured. Every
          project and organization listed is carefully vetted.
