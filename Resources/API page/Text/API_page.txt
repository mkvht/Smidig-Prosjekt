THE MELIORA API

THE MELIORA API

We have made an API to make it easy for you as a user to promote your philantropic activites. The API lets you fetch promotional images with updated information about the projects you have donated to, and what your contribution has resulted in.

You can use the API to always have updated images on your website or on information screens in your office, and you only need to set it up once.
You can also use this page to simply download a promotional image
