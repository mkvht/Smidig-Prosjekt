By using Meliora Impact's platform, companies can leverage their corporate resources for greater social good.

Donors who choose our platform get access to carefully selected nonprofits and projects to support, will receive inside stories about the projects and will see how their donations make an impact.

Donors get access to engaging reports on their philanthropic activity, continuously updated dashboards, and of course have full control over their donations.

In addition, corporate donors can sign up to receive a philanthropic strategy fully tailored to their business and values.
