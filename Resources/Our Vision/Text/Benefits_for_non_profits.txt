More nonprofits are going digital: payments, platforms, marketing and storytelling are done and supported online.


Individual donations via digital platforms have increased by 45% in 2020 in Norway alone.


This trend means that nonprofits need to spend time and money to develop those new solutions. Our platform gives the nonprofits exactly these tools (and more) for free, and ensures that also smaller nonprofits can be a part of the digitization without using up their own resources.
