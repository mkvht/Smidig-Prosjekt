Local partners
We work with local partners to help communities access clean water, decent restrooms and good hygiene. And we use our experience and research to influence decision-makers to do more to provide these essential services.
By working with local partners we’re able to deliver lasting change. By investing locally, we know that they can continue the good work even after we’re gone.

Practical technologies
We only use practical technologies and make sure the right skills exist locally so that households, communities and service providers can keep services working long into the future.
However, the sheer scale of the challenge means that WaterAid and our partners can’t solve it alone. So we work with communities and supporters to convince governments and service providers to prioritise investment in clean water and toilets for their citizens.
And we couldn’t make it happen without you. The incredible generosity and commitment of all our supporters - individuals, institutions and companies - is behind everything we do.
