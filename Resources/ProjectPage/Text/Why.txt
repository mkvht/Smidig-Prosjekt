71% of the world's population has access to safe drinking water sources- Here it is calculated that the sources are available where you live, and when you need them and without pollution. "Safe sources" include water in pipes, wells, public taps or pipes, drilling water or protected natural sources or rainwater.
New data reveals that 2.1 billion people gained access to a decent toilet and 1.8 billion people gained access to basic water access between 2000 and 2017.
